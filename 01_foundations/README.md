# 01_foundations: Mathematical Foundations Review

## Overview
This folder documents my systematic review of fundamental mathematical concepts essential for graduate-level Language Science and Technology. Coming from a humanities background, I'm rebuilding mathematical fluency from the ground up, with a focus on concepts that directly support computational linguistics and cognitive modeling.

## Learning Goals
- **Algebra**: Master polynomial manipulation, exponential/logarithmic functions, and systems of equations
- **Trigonometry**: Understand periodic functions, unit circle, and trigonometric identities
- **Statistics & Probability**: Grasp probability rules, distributions, and statistical inference
- **Integration**: Connect each area to applications in NLP and cognitive science

## Study Approach
**Primary Resource**: Khan Academy (structured, self-paced)
**Timeline**: September 2025 (4 weeks intensive review)
**Method**: Concept mastery → Practice problems → Linguistic applications → Documentation
