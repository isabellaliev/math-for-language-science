# Foundations: Algebra & Trigonometry

This folder documents my foundational review of algebra and trigonometry, which supports my transition into more advanced mathematical domains like linear algebra, calculus, and probabilistic modeling.

Topics include:
- Algebraic expressions, equations, and inequalities
- Function behavior and graphing
- Trigonometric ratios and signal modeling

These concepts form the backbone of formal reasoning and are essential for understanding optimization, vector spaces, and signal processing in NLP and speech technology.
