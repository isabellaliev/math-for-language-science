# 01_foundations: Mathematical Foundations Review

## Overview
This folder documents my systematic review of fundamental mathematical concepts essential for graduate-level Language Science and Technology. Coming from a humanities background, I'm rebuilding mathematical fluency from the ground up, with a focus on concepts that directly support computational linguistics and cognitive modeling.

## Study Approach
**Primary Resource**: Khan Academy (structured, self-paced)
**Method**: Concept mastery → Practice problems → Linguistic applications → Documentation

## Content and topics
### College Algebra Fundamentals
- Polynomial operations and factoring
- Rational expressions and equations
- Exponential and logarithmic functions
- Systems of linear equations
- Quadratic functions and transformations
- **Connection to NLP**: Linear systems in matrix operations, exponential decay in attention mechanisms
 
### Trigonometry
- Introduction to trigonometric functions
- Unit circle mastery and graphing trigonometric functions
- Trigonometric identities and equations
- Inverse trigonometric functions
- Introduction to complex numbers
- **Connection to NLP**: Fourier transforms, embedding space rotations

### Statistics and Probability
- Probability rules and conditional probability
- Random variables and distributions
- Descriptive statistics and data analysis
- Introduction to inference
- **Connection to NLP**: Language modeling, uncertainty quantification, Bayesian approaches

## Documentation Strategy

Each topic includes:
1. **Concept Notes**: Key definitions, formulas, and relationships
2. **Worked Examples**: Step-by-step problem solutions in Jupyter notebooks
3. **Linguistic Applications**: How this math applies to language science

## Linguistic Applications Preview

### Why These Foundations Matter for NLP:
- **Algebra**: Matrix operations, linear transformations in word embeddings
- **Exponentials/Logs**: Information theory, entropy, attention mechanisms
- **Trigonometry**: Signal processing, Fourier analysis of language patterns
- **Probability**: Language models, uncertainty in ambiguity analysis
- **Statistics**: Corpus analysis, significance testing, model evaluation

## Next Steps
Upon completion, this foundation will support:
- **Math for Machine Learning Specialization** (Coursera)
- **Linear Algebra for ML** applications
- **Probability theory** in language modeling
- **Calculus** for optimization in NLP.
  
This foundation phase is about building the mathematical intuition necessary for advanced computational linguistics work.
