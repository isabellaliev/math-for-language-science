# Probability & Statistics

This folder focuses on probabilistic reasoning and statistical analysis, which are central to NLP, psycholinguistics, and ambiguity modeling.

Topics include:
- Probability distributions and expected value
- Conditional probability and Bayes' theorem
- Hypothesis testing and statistical inference

These tools allow me to model uncertainty, interpret linguistic variation, and evaluate cognitive hypotheses with data-driven methods.
