## Math for Language Science and Technology ##

Mathematical foundations for computational linguistics and cognitive modeling, with applications to natural language processing and psycholinguistic research.

**Current Focus:**

Linear algebra for vector semantics and neural networks
Probability theory for language modeling and uncertainty quantification
Calculus for optimization in machine learning algorithms
Statistical inference for experimental design in psycholinguistics

**Structure**

Each folder represents a core mathematical domain, with concept summaries, annotated notebooks, and applied examples:

- linear-algebra/ - Matrix operations, eigenvalues, vector spaces
- probability-stats/ - Bayesian inference, hypothesis testing, distributions
- calculus/ - Optimization, gradients, chain rule applications
- applications/ - Math concepts applied to NLP problems
