# Calculus

This folder documents my study of calculus, with a focus on applications in optimization, learning algorithms, and cognitive modeling.

Topics include:
- Limits, derivatives, and integrals
- Function behavior and rate of change
- Gradient descent and multivariable optimization

Calculus is essential for modeling dynamic systems, training machine learning models, and analyzing linguistic patterns over time.
