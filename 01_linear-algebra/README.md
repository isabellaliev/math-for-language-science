# Linear Algebra

This folder explores core linear algebra concepts that underpin NLP embeddings, semantic spaces, and cognitive modeling.

Topics include:
- Vectors, matrices, and matrix operations
- Systems of equations and transformations
- Eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and dimensionality reduction

These concepts are foundational for understanding how language can be represented in high-dimensional spaces and manipulated computationally.
